# Aurelia-Cordova-Materialize

This isn't anything to special. Just wanted to share my code for a working example of using Visual Studio to create a Cordova app, using Aurelia and Materialized. 


Gulp is used to serve/watch so you can edit then save and then have that re-build - but, also, used to bundle which helps A LOT when building apps for cordova. 

Hope it helps somebody kick start a project.

video of a working example can be found here:

Good luck!
